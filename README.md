# RCTRIM
Python add-on for TRIM.
Takes information from EXYZ.txt and COLLISION.txt files to put together full nuclear recoil cascades and generate ionisation.


RCTRIM requires modified versions of the EXYZ.txt and COLLISION.txt files, but includes the conversion tool necessary to reformat them.

# srim_conversions.py
- The EXYZ.txt and COLLISION.txt files must be placed in directories with a specific structure. 
- You must know every element present in your TRIM simulation (projectile and target).
